# A Food Website (basic HTML CSS)
## This is a project created by me when i was in my class10 (2019).
Not only this, i had created several projects but have lost all of them this was the only one i can retain. <br>
In class 10, 2019, I was first introduced to the building blocks of WebD, HTML and CSS. I was fascinated by it, and diving more into webD, I picked up  my first programming language javascript. Build some websites, and participated in interschool WebD competitions which gave me even more exposure to the tech world. Since then in 2023 i'm returning back to this tech world, (2020-2022=>YT,JEE,Animation)
